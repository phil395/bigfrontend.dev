In this problem, you are asked to implement a enhanced `throttle()` which accepts third parameter, option: `{leading: boolean, trailing: boolean}`

leading: whether to invoke right away
trailing: whether to invoke after the delay.
implement basic throttle() is the default case with `{leading: true, trailing: true}`.
