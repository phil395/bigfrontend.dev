I believe you've used JSON.stringify() before, do you know the details of how it handles arbitrary data?

Please have a guess on the details and then take a look at the explanation on MDN, it is actually pretty complex.

In this problem, you are asked to implement your own version of JSON.stringify().

In a real interview, you are not expected to cover all the cases, just decide the scope with interviewer. But for a goal of practicing, your code here will be tested against a lot of data types. Please try to cover as much as you can.

Attention to the circular reference.

note

JSON.stringify() support two more parameters which is not required here.

Don't use JSON.stringify() in your code here, it doesn't help you practicing coding skills.
